# Modern-Coding-for-Dummies
A chapter-by-chapter guide on creating a full stack app, to teach you both full stack software engineering (SWE) skills, and data science skills. 

# 0.1 Purpose and Prerequisites
This is intended for someone with a basic understanding of "coding" (i.e. an understanding of loops, datatypes, etc.), and a basic understanding of computers (i.e. memory, the internet etc.). Essentially, the reader is a student in college who's taken CS courses but not done any real world projects. This guide aims to take the reader from a classroom understanding of "programming", and provide the skill set of a junior developer at a big tech company.

## Tech stack: 
* Front end: React (i.e JS, HTML, CSS) 
* Back end: Django (i.e. Python) AND Node JS (i.e. Javascript)
* Data layer: MongoDB (i.e. SQL) AND Firebase (i.e. NoSQL) 
* Deployment: AWS (i.e. deploying on a server) 

# 0.2 Sequence Of Events
Planning:
1. Create Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for database organization
2. Create a prototype User Interface (UI) with Figma 

Setup:
1. Setup VS code
2. Install any necessary compilers (e.g. Python 3.10 runtime, JS extensions for VSCode, etc.). Ensure the PATH variable points properly to the installations.
3. Install NPM (node package manager) -- to do this, install Node JS first. NPM comes with node js. You should be able to open a cmd prompt and type "npm" on successfull install.
4. Using NPM, install react (via create-react-app). 
5. Setup a MongoDB account + collection
6. Setup a Firebase account + collection
7. Setup an AWS account (goal: Cheap EC2 instance for deploying a website)

Coding:
1. Create a frontend with React. The frontend is comprised of surface level user interface:
- A "landing page" (i.e. the page that is displayed when the base URL, website.com, is typed in)
- A "router" -- i.e. software (typically a single JS file) that correlates URL paths input in the browser to HTML pages/elements displayed
- HTML elements/pages - HTML pages that contain the actual content displayed in the browser. Note that React handles these a bit funky via JSX
- Interactive JS components - HTML elements (e.g. Buttons) will "link" to JS to actually *do* things (e.g. an HTML button will have an "onclick" property, which will call a certain JS function when the button is clicked by the user)

2. Create a backend with Django/NodeJS. The backend is comprised of the actual function of the website:

# 1.0 Conceptual Overview
A conceptual breakdown of important topics that aren't code. It's organized in the same order that you might come across the topics (i.e. you write code /before/ trying to fix bugs)

# 1.1 Compilers and IDEs! Also, Virtual Environments

---------------------------------------
# 1.2 Version control systems (e.g. Github). Also, Hugging Face?
  
---------------------------------------
# 1.3 Full-stack (i.e. front-end vs. back-end vs. data-layer)? Also, 'Frameworks'

---------------------------------------
# 1.4 APIs

---------------------------------------
# 1.5 Stack overflow and ChatGPT? 

---------------------------------------
# 2.0 Project Overview: 
A high-level look at the project we're building. 



# 2.1 Project tools:
Figma 
Entity Relationship Diagram
User stories / etc.
