# Modern-Coding-for-Dummies
A chapter-by-chapter guide on creating a full stack app, to teach you both full stack software engineering (SWE) skills, and data science skills. 

# 0.1 Purpose and Prerequisites
This is intended for someone with a basic understanding of "coding" (i.e. an understanding of loops, datatypes, etc.), and a basic understanding of computers (i.e. memory, the internet etc.). Essentially, the reader is a student in college who's taken CS courses but not done any real world projects. This guide aims to take the reader from a classroom understanding of "programming", and provide the skill set of a junior developer at a big tech company.

# 0.2 Overview
This section aims to provide a conceptual breakdown of important non-code things. 
* Compilers and IDEs? 
* Version control systems (e.g. Github)
* Full stack?
* Stack overflow and ChatGPT?
* Hugging Face?
