# Modern-Coding-for-Dummies
A chapter-by-chapter guide on creating a full stack app, to teach you both full stack software engineering (SWE) skills, and data science skills. 

# 0.1 Purpose and Prerequisites
This is intended for someone with a basic understanding of "coding" (i.e. an understanding of loops, datatypes, etc.), and a basic understanding of computers (i.e. memory, the internet etc.). Essentially, the reader is a student in college who's taken CS courses but not done any real world projects. This guide aims to take the reader from a classroom understanding of "programming", and provide the skill set of a junior developer at a big tech company.

## Tech stack: 
Front end: React (i.e JS, HTML, CSS) 
Back end: Django (i.e. Python) 
Data layer: MongoDB (i.e. SQL) AND Firebase (i.e. NoSQL) 
Deployment: AWS (i.e. deploying on a server) 

# 0.2 Sequence Of Events
This repository will cover the following chapters in the following order:
0. 
1. 
2. 


# 1.0 Conceptual Overview
A conceptual breakdown of important topics that aren't code. It's organized in the same order that you might come across the topics (i.e. you write code /before/ trying to fix bugs)

# 1.1 Compilers and IDEs! Also, Virtual Environments

---------------------------------------
# 1.2 Version control systems (e.g. Github). Also, Hugging Face?
  
---------------------------------------
# 1.3 Full-stack (i.e. front-end vs. back-end vs. data-layer)? Also, 'Frameworks'

---------------------------------------
# 1.4 APIs

---------------------------------------
# 1.5 Stack overflow and ChatGPT? 

---------------------------------------
# 2.0 Project Overview: 
A high-level look at the project we're building
